The project aimed to address flight delays and their causes in the context of the U.S. aviation system. The goal was to provide a user-friendly tool for passengers to check for flight delays and understand common causes of delays at their frequently traveled airports.

**Accomplishments and Key Points:**

1. **Background**: The project recognized the significance of flight delays in air travel and sought to simplify the process for passengers to check for delays and understand their causes.

2. **Datasets**: The team utilized multiple datasets from Kaggle, including flight delay data and information on airport delays.

3. **Task 1 Implementation (MySQL and Firebase)**:
   - For the Emulated Distributed File System (EDFS) requirement, MySQL and Firebase implementations were developed.
   - MySQL was chosen for the backend server, using an Object-Oriented approach and partitioning by key for efficient data management.
   - Key methods were created to handle user input, file management, and directory structure.
   - Firebase implementation focused on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python functions, with a simplified approach compared to MySQL.

4. **Task 2 Implementation (Partition Mapping and Reduction)**:
   - Additional methods were implemented to support partition mapping and reduction.
   - SQL queries were constructed to search data from partitioned tables, and a reduction function combined the results.

5. **Task 3 Implementation (User Interface)**:
   - HTML and CSS were used to build a user interface for interacting with the Emulated Distributed File System.
   - The Flask framework facilitated communication between the frontend and Python backend.
   - Users could enter commands similar to Linux terminal commands to explore the file system.
   - Additionally, users could select a CSV file, enter query information, and receive results on the HTML page.

   
The project achieved its goal of simplifying the process for passengers to check flight delays and understand their causes, using a combination of data processing, database management, and user interface development. The team's learning experience included gaining insights into data science concepts and overcoming technical challenges in implementation.
